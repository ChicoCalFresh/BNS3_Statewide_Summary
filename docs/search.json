This may or may not include your roommate(s).\nBased on the household you defined in the previous question, how much is your household’s gross monthly income (before taxes and not including financial aid)? Note: Monthly income is money earned from jobs on your pay stubs, paid internships, or money deposited in your accounts every month from others (like parents). If you are not sure about your gross income, take your hourly rate and multiply by the number of hours you work per month. Please do NOT include financial aid or grants. Please do NOT include one-time monetary gifts from family or friends. Please do NOT include any balance in personal savings accounts. Remember, if you have a household of more than 1, you must include everyone’s gross income (use your best guess).\n\nAdditional Notes:  Household size and income are used to determine CalFresh eligibility (among other factors). Cells highlighted in green indicate a student is likely eligible for CalFresh based on their self-reported income/household size, and cells highlighted in red indicate a student is likely ineligible. Household size was asked in a multiple choice format with options ranging from “1 (myself)” to “8 or more (myself plus 7, etc.)” where those who reported eight or more were coded as “8.” Hence, there was some uncertainty in determining eligibility among students who reported a household size of eight or more and a higher income where these cells are highlighted in yellow.\nSummary: The most common household size reported was a household size of 1 while the most common income reported was $151-$2,148. A total of 112 students who had a household size of one with a monthly household income of less than $150, and 229 students who had a household size of one with a monthly household income of $151-$2,148 were deemed likely eligible for CalFresh. Of those with a household size of one, 83.2% met the income/household size eligibility criteria. Of those with a household size of two, 80.7% met the income/household size eligibility criteria."

At the time of the start of this survey, all EOP/EOPS programs were considered an LIPE, however, campuses now need to apply and receive approval for their program to be considered an LPIE. When determining eligibility, all students were assumed to meet the work requirement since they were all EOP/EOPS students.\n\n\nSummary: A total of 1341 (81.0%) students were likely eligible for CalFresh while 315 (19.0%) were likely not eligible. Many students selected “Prefer not to answer” when reporting their income. Calfresh eligibility was unable to be determined among these students and among any students who answered “Prefer not to answer” to household size."
