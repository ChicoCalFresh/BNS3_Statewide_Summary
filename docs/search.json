    "text": "Students were asked to report academic information. This includes information such as what college they are currently enrolled in, their class standing, major, GPA, and enrolled units. They were also asked questions about programs they participate in as well as what type of students they are (transfer, international, etc.). As a reminder, students had the option to select “Prefer not to answer” for all questions, and these responses were set as missing values. In addition, 186 (8.8%) students did not finish the survey. The n count for every survey question reflects the total number of non-missing responses while the percentage reflects the percent of non-missing responses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Survey Participants by Campus (n=12) (n=2110, 100% of 2110 reporting)\n\n\n\n\nSurvey Question:  Which campus do you attend?\nAdditional Notes:  The University of California (UC) campus (n=1) is shown in blue, while the California State University (CSU) campuses (n=6) are shown in red, and the California Community College (CCC) campuses (n=5) are shown in yellow.\nSummary:  A total of 1238 (58.7%), 690 (32.7%) and 182 (8.6%) college students were enrolled in CSU, CCC and UC campuses, respectively.

Similarly, the majority of students claimed only 1 person is fed through the EBT card (230 people). 138 students claim to feed 2 people through the EBT card, and only a small amount of students claim to feed 5 or more people through the EBT card.\n\n\nMonthly CalFresh Money\nHow much money is added to your CalFresh EBT card each month for your CalFresh household (i.e. the people you purchase and prepare food with)? (n=634, 30% of 2110 reporting)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average amount of money received per household using CalFresh (denoted by the dotted line) is $305.91, while the median is $250. The values range from $0 to $1500. The majority of households who do receive these benefits seems to be getting around $250 or less per month.\n\n\n\nHousehold Size Breakdown\nBelow is a breakdown of the average monthly allowance received from CalFresh based on household size.\n\n\n\n\n\nHousehold Size\nHousehold Average\nPer Person Average\n\n\n\n\n1\n$196.58\n$196.58\n\n\n2\n$309.51\n$154.76\n\n\n3\n$387.99\n$129.33\n\n\n4\n$450.56\n$112.64\n\n\n5\n$453.57\n$ 90.71\n\n\n6\n$536.85\n$ 89.48\n\n\n7\n$521.00\n$ 74.43\n\n\n8\n$402.14\n$ 50.27\n\n\n\nTotal Average\n$112.28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe general pattern seems to be that as household size increases so does the monthly average assistance from CalFresh. The household average was divided by the household size to find the “per person average” for CalFresh assistance. From taking the average of these values, we can see that a person on CalFresh receives an average monthly assistance of:\n\n\n\nPer Person Average\n\n$112.28\n\n\n.\n\n\nIs This Enough?\nNote: for the first graph on if the allowance is enough we have (n=623, 30% of 2110 reporting) And for the second graph on when people run out we have (n=586, 28% of 2110 reporting)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel that the amount that is added to my CalFresh EBT card each month is enough money to provide healthy food for the month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen do you typically use up the balance on your CalFresh EBT card?\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the students who do receive money from CalFresh, 224 of them agree that it is enough money to provide healthy food for a month and 288 of them feel that it is not enough. Students typically run out of CalFresh money in the first week (127 students), the second week (156 students) or the third week (160 students). A smaller minority run out within the fourth week or do not use up all their monthly balance."

    "text": "Students’ personal demographics (e.g. age, ethnicity, number of dependents, etc.) were obtained and visualized in this section. Specific survey questions and summaries are found below each figure. As a reminder, students had the option to select “Prefer not to answer” for all questions, and these responses were set as missing values. In addition, 186 (8.8%) students did not finish the survey. The n count for every survey question reflects the total number of non-missing responses while the percentage reflects the percent of non-missing responses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Reported age (years) by college students (n=2110, 100% of 2110 reporting)\n\n\n\n\nSurvey Question:  What is your date of birth?\nAdditional Notes:  Student age was determined by the difference between birth date and the time in which the survey was completed. Values were rounded down to the nearest whole number.\nSummary:  The average age of the students was 24.6 years with a range of 18 to 72 and the majority falling between 20-30 years old.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Reported gender identity by college students (n=2094, 99% of 2110 reporting)\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvey question:  What is your gender identity?\nSummary:  A total of 1642 (78.4%) students identified as a woman, 407 (19.4%) identified as a man, 27 (1.3%) identified as gender non-binary, and 15 (0.7%) identified as queer/non-conforming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Reported ethnic/Hispanic identity by college students (n=2070, 98% of 2110 reporting)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvey Question:  Do you identify as Hispanic or Latino or Spanish Origin?\nAdditional Notes:  Possible answers were pulled from the U.S. Census questionnaire assessing Hispanic Origin: Mexican, Mexican American, Chicano, Puerto Rican, Cuban, or another Hispanic/Latino/Spanish origin.\nSummary:  A total of 1436 (69.4%) students self-identified as having Hispanic Origins and 634 (30.6%) students self-identified as Non-Hispanic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: Reported race by college students (n=2110, 100% of 2110 reporting)\n\n\nIdentified Race\nYes (%)\n\n\n\n\nWhite\n859 (40.7%)\n\n\nPrefer not to answer race\n755 (35.8%)\n\n\nAsian\n321 (15.2%)\n\n\nBlack or African American\n167 (7.9%)\n\n\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native\n106 (5.0%)\n\n\nNative Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander\n40 (1.9%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvey Question:  What race do you identify as?

These 14 options were collapsed into the 5 broad U.S. Census groups due to small sample sizes in some groups.\nSummary:  A total of 859 (40.7%) students self-identified as White, 321 (15.2%) as Asian, 167 (7.9%) as Black or African American, 106 (5.0%) as American Indian or Alaskan Native, and 40 (1.9%) as Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Additionally, 755 (35.8%) students preferred not to answer race, likely due to confusion between race and ethnicity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Reported dependents by college students (n=2078, 98% of 2110 reporting)\n\n\n\n\nSurvey Question:  If you have dependents, then how many of them receive more than 50% of their financial support from you?\nAdditional Notes:  Approximately 1478 (71.1%) students reporting no dependents and 107 (5.1%) reporting dependents with less than 50% financial support were omitted from the chart.\nSummary:  A total of 493 students reported having dependents who receive more than 50% of their financial support.

First-generation status is defined by neither parent having completed a Bachelor’s degree or higher. The green bars represent first-generation categories and the blue bars represent non-first-generation categories. Other/unknown responses are shown in gray.\nSummary:  Approximately 1892 (93.8%) students reported first-generation status based on their parent/guardian education level. This outcome is not surprising because the students were either enrolled in EOP or EOPS and both programs recruit students with first-generation status. A total of 719 (34.5%) students reported their parents/guardians did not have a high school diploma or GED while 584 (28.0%) reported the highest level of education completed by their parents is high school.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Reported First-Generation Status by College Students (n=2017, 96% of 2110 reporting)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvey Question:  This variable was derived from the question in Figure 1.5\nAdditional Notes:  Students who selected their parents’ education as “Less than high school,” “High school diploma or GED,” “Some college,” “Certificate or technical achievement without Associate’s degree,” or “Associate’s degree” were considered first-generation.
