If you are an student, you may be enrolled in at least 6 academic units or more (equivalent to 18+ hours per week of academic workload) rather than having a paid/unpaid job. For more information on student eligibility, see the College Student Eligibility requirements on Chico State’s website.\nThe below graphs breaks down if a person meets the workload requirements based solely on one of the following criteria:\n\nAcademic workload - enrolled in 6 or more units (18 or more hours).\nPaid Workload - working 20+ weekly hours at a paid position.\nUnpaid Workload - working 20+ weekly hours at a unpaid position.\nTotal Workload - working 20+ weekly hours in total (combination of academic, paid, and unpaid).\n\nNote: people with a workload of 0 hours were included in the graph and analysis."
