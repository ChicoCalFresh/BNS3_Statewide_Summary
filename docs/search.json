If you are an student, you may be enrolled in at least 6 academic units or more (equivalent to 18+ hours per week of academic workload) rather than having a paid/unpaid job. For more information on student eligibility, see the College Student Eligibility requirements on Chico State’s website.\nThe below graphs breaks down if a person meets the workload requirements based solely on one of the following criteria:\n\nAcademic workload - enrolled in 6 or more units (18 or more hours).\nPaid Workload - working 20+ weekly hours at a paid position.\nUnpaid Workload - working 20+ weekly hours at a unpaid position.\nTotal Workload - working 20+ weekly hours in total (combination of academic, paid, and unpaid).\n\nNote: people with a workload of 0 hours were included in the graph and analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: CalFresh Eligibility"

Similarly, the majority of students claimed only 1 person is fed through the EBT card (230 people). 138 students claim to feed 2 people through the EBT card, and only a small amount of students claim to feed 5 or more people through the EBT card.\n\n\nMonthly CalFresh Money\nHow much money is added to your CalFresh EBT card each month for your CalFresh household (i.e. the people you purchase and prepare food with)? (n=634, 30% of 2110 reporting)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average amount of money received per household using CalFresh (denoted by the dotted line) is $305.91, while the median is $250. The values range from $0 to $1500. The majority of households who do receive these benefits seems to be getting around $250 or less per month.\n\n\n\nHousehold Size Breakdown\nBelow is a breakdown of the average monthly allowance received from CalFresh based on household size.\n\n\n\n\n\nHousehold Size\nHousehold Average\nPer Person Average\n\n\n\n\n1\n$196.58\n$196.58\n\n\n2\n$309.51\n$154.76\n\n\n3\n$387.99\n$129.33\n\n\n4\n$450.56\n$112.64\n\n\n5\n$453.57\n$ 90.71\n\n\n6\n$536.85\n$ 89.48\n\n\n7\n$521.00\n$ 74.43\n\n\n8\n$402.14\n$ 50.27\n\n\n\nTotal Average\n$112.28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe general pattern seems to be that as household size increases so does the monthly average assistance from CalFresh.

From taking the average of these values, we can see that a person on CalFresh receives an average monthly assistance of:\n\n\n\nPer Person Average\n\n\n$112.28\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nIs This Enough?\nNote: for the first graph on if the allowance is enough we have (n=623, 30% of 2110 reporting) And for the second graph on when people run out we have (n=586, 28% of 2110 reporting)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel that the amount that is added to my CalFresh EBT card each month is enough money to provide healthy food for the month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen do you typically use up the balance on your CalFresh EBT card?\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the students who do receive money from CalFresh, 224 of them agree that it is enough money to provide healthy food for a month and 288 of them feel that it is not enough. Students typically run out of CalFresh money in the first week (127 students), the second week (156 students) or the third week (160 students). A smaller minority run out within the fourth week or do not use up all their monthly balance."

    "text": "Figure Interpretation\n\nMost questions fall under one of the following types of figure styles. Here are some notes on how to interpret them.\n\n\nTables\n\n\n\n\nTable 1. 1: Table Caption\n\n\nQuestions\nResponses\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1 (n = #)\nResponse # (%)\n\n\nQuestion 2 (n = #)\nResponse # (%)\n\n\nQuestion 3 (n = #)\nResponse # (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTables were used to group together sets of questions that typically had a Yes/No response pattern.\nThe left column represents the questions along with the numbers of students who responded to the question.\nThe right column represents the number of student who responded a certain way, along with the percent that responded this way (out of all the students in total that responded).\n\n\n\n\nBarplots\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. 1: Figure Caption\n\n\n\n\n\nBarplots were used to graph questions which had nominal or ordinal responses (labeled data that’s separated into different groups). The x-axis is the response option, and the y-axis is the frequency in which they occured.\nThe numbers above the bars represent the total respondents in the given group, as well as the percent of the data that they comprise.\n\n\n\n\nHistograms\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. 2: Figure Caption\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to the barplot above, the histogram shows the distribution for a numeric variable of interest on the x-axis and the frequency in which they occured on the y-axis.\nThe mean of the variable of interest is denoted by a vertical dotted line.\n\n\n\n\nLikert Plots\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. 3: Figure Caption\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Likert plot is a barplot visualization for a Likert scale, which is used to measure feelings/opinions for a specific question.\n\nThe center line (0%) divides the responses into two groups, such as above where the left side of the chart represents strongly disagree/disagree/neither agree nor disagree and the right hand side represents agree/strongly agree.\n\nThe percentages represent the proportion of the data for which the “group” composes.\n\nThe (n=#) next to the question denotes how many students responded to a specific question. The values can vary for each question within the same plot."
