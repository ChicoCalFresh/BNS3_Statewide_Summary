Similarly, the majority of people claimed only 1 person is fed through the EBT card (230 people). 138 people claim to feed 2 people through the EBT card, and only a small amount of people claim to feed 5 or more people through the EBT card.\n\n\nMonthly CalFresh Money\nHow much money do you receive from CalFresh each month? (n=634, 30% of 2110 reporting).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average amount of money received per household using CalFresh (denoted by the dotted line) is $305.91, while the median is $250. The values range from $0 to $1500. The majority of households who do receive these benefits seems to be getting around $250 or less per month.\n\n\nHousehold Size Breakdown\nBelow is a breakdown of the average monthly allowance received from CalFresh based on household size.\n\n\n\n\n\nHousehold Size\nHousehold Average\nPer Person Average\n\n\n\n\n1\n$196.58\n$196.58\n\n\n2\n$309.51\n$154.76\n\n\n3\n$387.99\n$129.33\n\n\n4\n$450.56\n$112.64\n\n\n5\n$453.57\n$ 90.71\n\n\n6\n$536.85\n$ 89.48\n\n\n7\n$521.00\n$ 74.43\n\n\n8\n$402.14\n$ 50.27\n\n\n\nTotal Average\n$112.28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the above table, the general pattern seems to be that as household size increases so does the monthly average assistance from CalFresh. The household average was divided by the household size to find the “per person average” for CalFresh assistance. From taking the average of these values, we can see that a person on CalFresh receives an average monthly assistance of $112.28.\n\n\nIs This Enough?\nNote: for the first graph on if the allowance is enough we have (n=623, 30% of 2110 reporting). And for the second graph on when people run out we have (n=586, 28% of 2110 reporting).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the people who do receive money from CalFresh, 224 of them agree that it is enough money to provide healthy food for a month and 288 of them feel that it is not enough. People typically run out of CalFresh money in the first week (127 people), the second week (156 people) or the third week (160 people). A smaller minority run out within the fourth week or do not use up all their monthly balance."

SAC Community College, Palo Verde Community College, CSU Bakersfield, CSU Dominguez Hills, CSU LA, CSU Sacramento, CSU San Bernadino, CSU San Francisco, and UC Berkley.\nFood insecurity among college students is a serious problem that can impact student performance in the classroom and ultimately effect student success. The Center for Healthy Communities (CHC) developed the Basic Needs Student Success Survey (BNS3) and administered it to undergraduate students participating in the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) at Chico State, Fresno State and CSU, Northridge from November 25\\(^{th}\\), 2020 to March 24\\(^{th}\\), 2021. The EOP office assisted in the recruitment and provided computers for students to take the survey. Participants were given a $25 gift card for their participation. EOP students were identified as the target population for this survey based upon their low-income and first-generation student status, which indicates a higher probability of CalFresh eligibility.\nThe purpose of this second cross-sectional pilot study was to revise the BNS3 tool and validate student perception of the following:\n\nThe impact of receiving CalFresh assistance.\nThe impact of utilization of the campus food pantry on their health, nutrition, cooking confidence, time management and academic performance.\n\nThis report provides a top level descriptive analysis of each question in the survey. Researchers and campus staff are encouraged to review the information in this analysis to formulate additional research questions and hypotheses.\nDisclaimer on Missing Data: Students were allowed to select answers such as “Prefer not to answer” or “I don’t know” as responses to every question asked. These answers were then converted to missing values, denoted as NA, and this is the cause of the missing data for certain questions (not 100% of respondents reporting).

This seems to be the most commonly performed type of exercise from the graph above (typically the highest number of days per week out of all exercise types).\n\n\n\nStrength Training\nHow often did you do 8-10 strength training exercises (such as resistance weight machines) for at least 8 repetitions each? (n=1852, 88% of 2110 reporting).\n\nThe majority of participants claim to have done 0 days days of strength training in the past week (1066 people). The general trend is that as the number of days increases, the number of students who exercised for those given number of days decreases. Only a small number of people claim to do strength training for 3 or more days in the past week.\n\n\n\nVigorous Exercise\nHow often did you do vigorous-intensity cardio or aerobic exercise (caused large increases in breathing or heart rate, such as jogging) for at least 20 minutes? (n=1856, 88% of 2110 reporting).\n\nThe majority of participants claim to have done days of vigorous exercise in the past week (898 people). The general trend is that as the number of days increases, the number of students who exercised for those given number of days decreases. Only a small number of people claim to do vigorous exercise for 4 or more days in the past week."

For more information on student eligibility, see the College Student Eligibility requirements on Chico State’s website.\nThe below graphs breaks down if a person meets the workload requirements based solely on one of the following criteria:\n\nAcademic workload - enrolled in 6 or more units (18 or more hours).\nPaid Workload - working 20+ weekly hours at a paid position.\nUnpaid Workload - working 20+ weekly hours at a unpaid position.\nTotal Workload - working 20+ weekly hours in total (combination of academic, paid, and unpaid).\n\nNote: people with a workload of 0 hours were included in the graph and analysis."
