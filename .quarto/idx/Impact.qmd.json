Students were asked to evaluate how they feel these programs have benefited them both academically and non-academically, as well as barriers/reasons in regards to why they are not using certain programs. This includes programs such as CalFresh, Food Pantries, Medi-Cal (also known as Medi-Cade in the United States), and Emergency Housing Services.\n\n<br>\n\n\n*Note: for the first graph on EBT application we have `r print_n_reporting(\"q47\")` And for the second graph on how many people are fed we have `r print_n_reporting(\"fed_through_EBT\")`*\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-width: 5\np1 <- plot_frq(bns$q47, wrap.title = 40, ylim=c(0,500), wrap.labels = 15, \n               title=\"Did you apply for CalFresh EBT as an individual or with other people in your household?\") +\n  xlab('')\np2 <- plot_frq(bns$fed_through_EBT, wrap.title = 40, title=\"How many people in the household are regularly fed through your CalFresh EBT card?\") + xlab('')\n\np1\np2\nrm(p1,p2)\n```\n\nLooking at the above graphs, the majority of people apply for CalFresh EBT as an individual (`r unname(table(bns$q47)['As an individual'])` people) while only `r unname(table(bns$q47)['With other people in my household'])` people applied with other people in their household. Similarly, the majority of people claimed only `r names(sort(table(bns$fed_through_EBT), decreasing = TRUE))[1]` person is fed through the EBT card (`r unname(sort(table(bns$fed_through_EBT), decreasing = TRUE))[1]` people). `r unname(sort(table(bns$fed_through_EBT), decreasing = TRUE))[2]` people claim to feed `r names(sort(table(bns$fed_through_EBT), decreasing = TRUE))[2]` people through the EBT card, and only a small amount of people claim to feed 5 or more people through the EBT card.\n\n<br>\n\n### Monthly CalFresh Money\n\n**How much money do you receive from CalFresh each month? `r print_n_reporting(\"q49_1\")`**\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-width: 7\n\ngghistogram(bns, x = \"q49_1\", add = \"mean\", fill = chc_blue, alpha = 1) + xlab(\"Monthly EBT Received ($)\") + ylab(\"Frequency\")\n\n#is $1500 a feasible response?\n```\n\nThe average amount of money received per household using CalFresh (denoted by the dotted line) is \\$`r round(mean(bns$q49_1, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, while the median is \\$`r round(median(bns$q49_1, na.rm=TRUE),2)`. The values range from \\$`r min(bns$q49_1, na.rm=TRUE)` to \\$`r max(bns$q49_1, na.rm=TRUE)`. The majority of households who do receive these benefits seems to be getting around \\$250 or less per month.\n\n### Household Size Breakdown\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the average monthly allowance received from CalFresh based on household size.\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-width: 6.5\ntmp <- bns %>% group_by(fed_through_EBT) %>% \n  summarise(avg = round(mean(q49_1, na.rm=TRUE),2)) %>% \n  na.omit() %>% mutate(HH.avg = round(avg/fed_through_EBT, 2),\n                       fed_through_EBT = as.character(fed_through_EBT),\n                       avg = paste0(\"$\", format(avg, nsmall=2)))\n\ntmp[9,] <- list(\"\", \"Total Average\", round(mean(tmp$HH.avg),2))\ntmp <- tmp %>% mutate(HH.avg = paste0(\"$\", format(HH.avg, nsmall=2)))\ncolnames(tmp) <- c(\"Household Size\", \"Household Average\", \"Per Person Average\")\n\ntmp %>% kable() %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = \"striped\") %>%\n  row_spec(9, bold=TRUE)\n```\n\nLooking at the above table, the general pattern seems to be that as household size increases so does the monthly average assistance from CalFresh. The household average was divided by the household size to find the \"per person average\" for CalFresh assistance. From taking the average of these values, we can see that a person on CalFresh receives an average monthly assistance of `r tmp[9,3]`.\n\n### Is This Enough?\n\n*Note: for the first graph on if the allowance is enough we have `r print_n_reporting(\"q50\")` And for the second graph on when people run out we have `r print_n_reporting(\"q51\")`*\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-width: 6\np1 <- plot_frq(bns$q50, ylim=c(0,200), title=\"I feel that the amount that is added to my CalFresh EBT card each month is enough money to provide healthy food for the month.\") + xlab('')\np2 <- plot_frq(bns$q51, ylim=c(0, 210), wrap.labels = 12, title=\"When do you typically use up the balance on your CalFresh EBT card?\") + xlab('')\n\np1\np2\nrm(p1,p2)\n```\n\nOf the people who do receive money from CalFresh, `r unname(table(bns$q50)['Agree']) + unname(table(bns$q50)['Strongly agree'])` of them agree that it is enough money to provide healthy food for a month and `r unname(table(bns$q50)['Disagree']) + unname(table(bns$q50)['Strongly disagree'])` of them feel that it is not enough. People typically run out of CalFresh money in the first week (`r unname(table(bns$q51)['First week after receiving benefits'])` people), the second week (`r unname(table(bns$q51)['Second week after receiving benefits'])` people) or the third week (`r unname(table(bns$q51)['Third week after receiving benefits'])` people). A smaller minority run out within the fourth week or do not use up all their monthly balance.\n\n<br>\n\n## CalFresh Benefits\n\n**While you received CalFresh benefits:**\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-height: 8\n#| fig-width: 8.5\nquestions <- bns %>% select(starts_with(\"q52_\"))\nnames(questions) <- c('I worked fewer hours each week in a PAID position.',\n                      'I had more time to do an UNPAID internship or volunteer work.',\n                      'I had more money to pay for bills (rent, utility bills, clothes, etc.).',\n                      'I had more money for entertainment and social activities.',\n                      'I shopped more frequently at the farmers market.',\n                      'I had learned more about healthier foods.',\n                      'I purchased healthier foods.',\n                      'I cooked more frequently at home.',\n                      'I consumed a healthier diet.',\n                      'I consumed less fast food.',\n                      'I consumed fewer processed foods.',\n                      'I consumed fewer sugar-sweetened beverages like soda and energy drinks.',\n                      'I consumed less alcohol or fewer alcoholic beverages.',\n                      'I concentrated more in class(es).',\n                      'My grades had improved.',\n                      'My grades had decreased.',\n                      'I kept up with course materials..',\n                      'I had more time to go to my professors office hours and tutoring services when needed.',\n                      'I had more time to attend all classes as they are scheduled.',\n                      'I had more time to go on field trips or internships.',\n                      'My sleep quality had improved.',\n                      'My stress/anxiety level had decreased.')\nplot_likert(questions[1:11],\n            grid.range = c(1.2, 1.2),\n            wrap.legend.labels = 20,\n            expand.grid = FALSE,\n            values = \"sum.outside\",\n            catcount = 5,\n            geom.colors = likert.pal.5,\n            show.prc.sign = TRUE, reverse.scale = TRUE) + theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = \"top\")\n\nplot_likert(questions[12:22],\n            grid.range = c(1.2, 1.2),\n            wrap.legend.labels = 20,\n            expand.grid = FALSE,\n            values = \"sum.outside\",\n            catcount = 5,\n            geom.colors = likert.pal.5,\n            show.prc.sign = TRUE, reverse.scale = TRUE) + theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = \"top\")\n```\n\n## CalFresh Barriers\n\n**What are the reasons you do not have CalFresh or have never used CalFresh?

Similarly, the majority of people claimed only `r names(sort(table(bns$fed_through_EBT), decreasing = TRUE))[1]` person is fed through the EBT card (`r unname(sort(table(bns$fed_through_EBT), decreasing = TRUE))[1]` people). `r unname(sort(table(bns$fed_through_EBT), decreasing = TRUE))[2]` people claim to feed `r names(sort(table(bns$fed_through_EBT), decreasing = TRUE))[2]` people through the EBT card, and only a small amount of people claim to feed 5 or more people through the EBT card.\n\n<br>\n\n### Monthly CalFresh Money\n\n**How much money do you receive from CalFresh each month? `r print_n_reporting(\"q49_1\")`**\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-width: 7\n\ngghistogram(bns, x = \"q49_1\", add = \"mean\", fill = chc_blue, alpha = 1) + xlab(\"Monthly EBT Received ($)\") + ylab(\"Frequency\")\n\n#is $1500 a feasible response?\n```\n\nThe average amount of money received per household using CalFresh (denoted by the dotted line) is \\$`r round(mean(bns$q49_1, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, while the median is \\$`r round(median(bns$q49_1, na.rm=TRUE),2)`. The values range from \\$`r min(bns$q49_1, na.rm=TRUE)` to \\$`r max(bns$q49_1, na.rm=TRUE)`. The majority of households who do receive these benefits seems to be getting around \\$250 or less per month.\n\n### Household Size Breakdown\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the average monthly allowance received from CalFresh based on household size.\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-width: 6.5\ntmp <- bns %>% group_by(fed_through_EBT) %>% \n  summarise(avg = round(mean(q49_1, na.rm=TRUE),2)) %>% \n  na.omit() %>% mutate(HH.avg = round(avg/fed_through_EBT, 2),\n                       fed_through_EBT = as.character(fed_through_EBT),\n                       avg = paste0(\"$\", format(avg, nsmall=2)))\n\ntmp[9,] <- list(\"\", \"Total Average\", round(mean(tmp$HH.avg),2))\ntmp <- tmp %>% mutate(HH.avg = paste0(\"$\", format(HH.avg, nsmall=2)))\ncolnames(tmp) <- c(\"Household Size\", \"Household Average\", \"Per Person Average\")\n\ntmp %>% kable() %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = \"striped\") %>%\n  row_spec(9, bold=TRUE)\n```\n\nLooking at the above table, the general pattern seems to be that as household size increases so does the monthly average assistance from CalFresh. The household average was divided by the household size to find the \"per person average\" for CalFresh assistance. From taking the average of these values, we can see that a person on CalFresh receives an average monthly assistance of `r tmp[9,3]`.\n\n### Is This Enough?\n\n*Note: for the first graph on if the allowance is enough we have `r print_n_reporting(\"q50\")` And for the second graph on when people run out we have `r print_n_reporting(\"q51\")`*\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-width: 6\np1 <- plot_frq(bns$q50, ylim=c(0,200), title=\"I feel that the amount that is added to my CalFresh EBT card each month is enough money to provide healthy food for the month.\") + xlab('')\np2 <- plot_frq(bns$q51, ylim=c(0, 210), wrap.labels = 12, title=\"When do you typically use up the balance on your CalFresh EBT card?\") + xlab('')\n\np1\np2\nrm(p1,p2)\n```\n\nOf the people who do receive money from CalFresh, `r unname(table(bns$q50)['Agree']) + unname(table(bns$q50)['Strongly agree'])` of them agree that it is enough money to provide healthy food for a month and `r unname(table(bns$q50)['Disagree']) + unname(table(bns$q50)['Strongly disagree'])` of them feel that it is not enough. People typically run out of CalFresh money in the first week (`r unname(table(bns$q51)['First week after receiving benefits'])` people), the second week (`r unname(table(bns$q51)['Second week after receiving benefits'])` people) or the third week (`r unname(table(bns$q51)['Third week after receiving benefits'])` people). A smaller minority run out within the fourth week or do not use up all their monthly balance.\n\n<br>\n\n## CalFresh Benefits\n\n**While you received CalFresh benefits:**\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-height: 8\n#| fig-width: 8.5\nquestions <- bns %>% select(starts_with(\"q52_\"))\nnames(questions) <- c('I worked fewer hours each week in a PAID position.',\n                      'I had more time to do an UNPAID internship or volunteer work.',\n                      'I had more money to pay for bills (rent, utility bills, clothes, etc.).',\n                      'I had more money for entertainment and social activities.',\n                      'I shopped more frequently at the farmers market.',\n                      'I had learned more about healthier foods.',\n                      'I purchased healthier foods.',\n                      'I cooked more frequently at home.',\n                      'I consumed a healthier diet.',\n                      'I consumed less fast food.',\n                      'I consumed fewer processed foods.',\n                      'I consumed fewer sugar-sweetened beverages like soda and energy drinks.',\n                      'I consumed less alcohol or fewer alcoholic beverages.',\n                      'I concentrated more in class(es).',\n                      'My grades had improved.',\n                      'My grades had decreased.',\n                      'I kept up with course materials..',\n                      'I had more time to go to my professors office hours and tutoring services when needed.',\n                      'I had more time to attend all classes as they are scheduled.',\n                      'I had more time to go on field trips or internships.',\n                      'My sleep quality had improved.',\n                      'My stress/anxiety level had decreased.')\nplot_likert(questions[1:11],\n            grid.range = c(1.2, 1.2),\n            wrap.legend.labels = 20,\n            expand.grid = FALSE,\n            values = \"sum.outside\",\n            catcount = 5,\n            geom.colors = likert.pal.5,\n            show.prc.sign = TRUE, reverse.scale = TRUE) + theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = \"top\")\n\nplot_likert(questions[12:22],\n            grid.range = c(1.2, 1.2),\n            wrap.legend.labels = 20,\n            expand.grid = FALSE,\n            values = \"sum.outside\",\n            catcount = 5,\n            geom.colors = likert.pal.5,\n            show.prc.sign = TRUE, reverse.scale = TRUE) + theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = \"top\")\n```\n\n## CalFresh Barriers\n\n**What are the reasons you do not have CalFresh or have never used CalFresh?
