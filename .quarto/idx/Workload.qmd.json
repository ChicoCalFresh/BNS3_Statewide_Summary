Only a small number `r nrow(bns$paid_work_hours >= 40)` of participants are considered to be working full-time (40 or more hours per week). Below is a breakdown of the exact paid hours worked by survey participants.\n\n<br>\n\n### Impact of COVID\n\n**Have the hours you work in a PAID job or internship changed due to COVID-19? `r print_n_reporting('q20')`**\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-width: 8\nplot_frq(bns$q20, ylim=c(0,700), wrap.labels = 19, sort.frq = 'desc') + xlab('') + ylab(\"Frequency\")\n```\n\nWith the impact of COVID, the data indicates that most employed survey participants were able to keep their current paid jobs with only slight changes. `r unname(table(bns$q20)['Yes, my hours have decreased but I still have a job.'])` students had their hours decrease, `r unname(table(bns$q20)['No, my hours have remained the same.'])` students maintained the same hours, and `r unname(table(bns$q20)['Yes, my hours have increased and I still have a job or I have a new job.'])` students had their hours increase.

A minority (`r unname(table(bns$caregiving_hours)['0'])`) of participants estimated that they spent 0 hours per week for family obligations. `r unname(table(bns$caregiving_hours > 40)[2])` participants reported 40 or more hours per week on these family obligations.

All able-bodied adults are required to work a minimum of 80 hours per month, which can be broken down into roughly 20 hours per week. This can be either paid or unpaid work, and more information on this requirement can be found on the [Department of Social Services](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/calfresh/abawd#:~:text=People%20who%20are%20ABAWDs%20must,%2C%20and%20in%2Dkind%20work.) website. If you are an student, you may be enrolled in at least 6 academic units or more (equivalent to 18+ hours per week of academic workload) rather than having a paid/unpaid job. For more information on student eligibility, see the [College Student Eligibility](https://www.csuchico.edu/calfresh/basics/college-student-eligibility.shtml) requirements on Chico State's website.\n\nThe below graphs breaks down if a person meets the workload requirements based solely on one of the following criteria:\n\n-   Academic workload - enrolled in 6 or more units (18 or more hours).\n-   Paid Workload - working 20+ weekly hours at a paid position.\n-   Unpaid Workload - working 20+ weekly hours at a unpaid position.\n-   Total Workload - working 20+ weekly hours in total (combination of academic, paid, and unpaid).\n\n*Note: people with a workload of 0 hours were included in the graph and analysis.*\n\n```{r}\ntmp <- tmp2\ntmp <- tmp %>% mutate(student=factor(ifelse(is.na(q18), NA, \n                                            ifelse(q18 >= 6, \"Eligible\", \"Not Eligible\")),\n                                     levels=c(\"Not Eligible\", \"Eligible\")),\n                      paid=factor(ifelse(is.na(paid_work_hours), NA, \n                                         ifelse(paid_work_hours >= 20, \"Eligible\", \"Not Eligible\"))\n                                  , levels=c(\"Not Eligible\", \"Eligible\")),\n                      unpaid=factor(ifelse(is.na(unpaid_work_hours), NA, \n                                           ifelse(unpaid_work_hours >= 20, \"Eligible\", \"Not Eligible\")),\n                                    levels=c(\"Not Eligible\", \"Eligible\")),\n                      total=factor(ifelse(is.na(TotalHours), NA, \n                                          ifelse(TotalHours >= 20, \"Eligible\", \"Not Eligible\")), \n                                   levels=c(\"Not Eligible\", \"Eligible\"))) %>%\n  select(student, paid, unpaid, total)\n\nnames(tmp) <- c(\"Academic Workload\", \"Paid Workload\", \"Unpaid Workload\", \"Total Workload\")\n\nplot_likert(tmp,\n            grid.range = c(1.4, 1.4),\n            wrap.legend.labels = 20,\n            expand.grid = FALSE,\n            values = \"sum.outside\",\n            catcount = 2,\n            geom.colors = c(\"#D8B365\",\"#5AB4AC\"),\n            show.prc.sign = TRUE, reverse.scale = TRUE) + theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = \"top\")\n```\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r, include=FALSE}\nsource(\"common_code.R\")\n\ntmp2 <- data.frame(bns, q18=bns$q18, paid_work_hours=bns$paid_work_hours, unpaid_work_hours=bns$unpaid_work_hours, school=bns$school)\ntmp2$units <- tmp2$q18*3\ntmp2$NonAcademic <- ifelse(is.na(tmp2[,'paid_work_hours']) & is.na(tmp2[,\"unpaid_work_hours\"]) & is.na(tmp2[,\"caregiving_hours\"]), NA,  rowSums(tmp2[, c('paid_work_hours','unpaid_work_hours', 'caregiving_hours')], na.rm = TRUE))\ntmp2$TotalHours <- ifelse(is.na(tmp2[, 'units']) & is.na(tmp2[,'NonAcademic']), NA,  rowSums(tmp2[, c('units','NonAcademic')], na.rm = TRUE))\n```\n\nThe following questions were asked in regards to the weekly workload taken on by students.
