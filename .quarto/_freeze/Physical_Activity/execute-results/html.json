In addition, 186 (8.8%) students did not finish the survey. The n reporting refers to the total number of non-missing responses while the percent reporting reflects the percent of non-missing responses.*\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" tbl-cap='Table 9.1.

In the table, percentages are calculated accross rows. \n\n**Summary:** The majority of students reported doing moderate-intensity exercises at least once in the past seven days, and 565 (30.4%) reported doing this zero times. About half the students reported doing strength training exercises at least once in the past 7 days, and 898 (48.4%) reported doing this zero times. Less than half of the students reported doing vigorous-intensity cardio or aerobic exercises at least once in the past 7 days, and 1066 (57.6%) reported doing this zero times. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[^1]: These questions were developed based on the [Surgeon General's physical activity guidelines for adults](https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf) who recommend: 150 minutes to 300 minutes a week of moderate-intensity exercise, 75 minutes to 150 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. They also recommend strength-training activities on 2 or more days a week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
