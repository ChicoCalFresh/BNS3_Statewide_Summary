This includes work from both paid/unpaid jobs, as well as time spent care-giving for a family member. Students academic workload is also looked at in order to see the hours spent each week on school work, as well as looking at the combined hours across academic and non-academic responsibilities.\n\n<br>\n\n## Weekly Paid Work Hours\n\n**Estimate the number of hours you work in a PAID job (for example, server at a restaurant, office assistant, etc.) or paid internship (for example, training, shadowing, or practicum) per week. (n=1930, 91% of 2110 reporting)**\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Workload_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nStudents reported a wide range of paid hours per week, with 50% of them reporting between 0 and 25  hours, with an average of 14.67 and median of 13. The majority of students work either part-time or not at all. Only a small number 2110 of students are considered to be working full-time (40 or more hours per week). Below is a breakdown of the exact paid hours worked by students.\n\n<br>\n\n### Impact of COVID\n\n**Have the hours you work in a PAID job or internship changed due to COVID-19? (n=1852, 88% of 2110 reporting)**\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Workload_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){fig-align='center' width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWith the impact of COVID, the data indicates that most employed students were able to keep their current paid jobs with only slight changes. 388 students had their hours decrease, 504 students maintained the same hours, and 125 students had their hours increase. There was also 299 students who claimed that they no longer had their paid position due to the impact of COVID, while 536 students also claimed that they did not have a paid position before COVID.\n\n## Unpaid Work Hours\n\n**Estimate the number of hours you work in an UNPAID internship (for example, training, shadowing, practicum, and/or volunteer, etc.). Do not combine with answers above. (n=1806, 86% of 2110 reporting)**\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Workload_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe majority of students (1387) do not work an unpaid job. A small number of students work part-time at an unpaid job and only a select few work full-time at an unpaid job. Below is a breakdown of the number of unpaid hours worked per week.\n\n<br>\n\n## Unpaid Caregiving Hours\n\n**Estimate the number of hours you spend each week on unpaid family obligations (for example, taking care of younger siblings, preparing family meals, running errands for the family, etc.) (n=1880, 89% of 2110 reporting)**\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Workload_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe majority of students (1449) do spend some time each week caring for family members. A minority (431) of students estimated that they spent 0 hours per week for family obligations. 232 students reported 40 or more hours per week on these family obligations. Below is a breakdown of these unpaid hours spent on family obligations each week.\n\n<br>\n\n## Academic Workload\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Workload_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe average number of academic hours worked per week (denoted by the dotted line) is 38.57, while the median is 39 hours. The majority of students do seem to be working 36 or more hours per week, with 36 hours being most common (502 people) and 45 hours following that (464 people).\n\n<br />\n\n## Non-Academic Workload\n\n**Below is a combination of both paid and unpaid hours worked by students to get a further understanding of the workload students face on a weekly basis. (n=0, NA of 2110 reporting)**\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Workload_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe average number of total hours worked per week (denoted by the dotted line) is 35.98, while the median is 30 hours. The majority of students do seem to be working under 40 hours per week in total, with 0 hours being most common (258 people) and 40 hours following that (121 people).\n\n<br />\n\n## Total Workload\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n**Below is a combination of all worked hours per week, both academic and non-academic. This includes units (3 hr/unit), paid, and unpaid worked hours (n=2095, 99% of 2110 reporting)**\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Workload_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe average number of total hours worked per week (denoted by the dotted line) is 72.52, while the median is 68 hours. The majority of students do seem to be working over full-time in total, with 45 hours being most common (83 people) and 36 hours following that (81 people).\n\n<br />\n\n## CalFresh Workload\n\nPeople are required to meet a certain work criteria in order to receive CalFresh benefits. All able-bodied adults are required to work a minimum of 80 hours per month, which can be broken down into roughly 20 hours per week. This can be either paid or unpaid work, and more information on this requirement can be found on the [Department of Social Services](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/calfresh/abawd#:~:text=People%20who%20are%20ABAWDs%20must,%2C%20and%20in%2Dkind%20work.) website. If you are an student, you may be enrolled in at least 6 academic units or more (equivalent to 18+ hours per week of academic workload) rather than having a paid/unpaid job. For more information on student eligibility, see the [College Student Eligibility](https://www.csuchico.edu/calfresh/basics/college-student-eligibility.shtml) requirements on Chico State's website.\n\nThe below graphs breaks down if a person meets the workload requirements based solely on one of the following criteria:\n\n-   Academic workload - enrolled in 6 or more units (18 or more hours).\n-   Paid Workload - working 20+ weekly hours at a paid position.\n-   Unpaid Workload - working 20+ weekly hours at a unpaid position.\n-   Total Workload - working 20+ weekly hours in total (combination of academic, paid, and unpaid).\n\n<!---\n*Note: people with a workload of 0 hours were included in the graph and analysis.*\n--->\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Workload_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n",
