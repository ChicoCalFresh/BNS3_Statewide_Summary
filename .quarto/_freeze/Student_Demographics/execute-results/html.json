This includes information such as what college they are currently enrolled in, their class standing, major, GPA, and enrolled units. They were also asked questions about programs they participate in as well as what type of student they are (transfer, international, etc.) to help identify students.\n\n<br>\n\n## School\n\n**Which campus do you attend? (n=2110, 100% of 2110 reporting)**\n\n<div class = \"row\">\n\n<div class = \"col-md-7\">\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Student_Demographics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){fig-align='center' width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTwelve campuses participated in this statewide survey. Of the twelve campuses, five were community colleges, six were California State Universities, and one was a University of California. The majority of students (1238) were currently enrolled in a state school. Fewer students (690) reported enrollment in a community college, and a small minority (182) reported enrollment in a UC. <br>\n\nconsider using ggdotchart and color/org by sector https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/reference/ggdotchart.html (this is a note for Robin and Saul to do. leave it.)\n\n## Class Standing\n\n**Estimate your class standing by units completed (n=2065, 98% of 2110 reporting)**\n\n<div class = \"row\">\n\n<div class = \"col-md-7\">\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Student_Demographics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){fig-align='center' width=528}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe Statewide survey captures students of all class standing. Of the 2065 respondents, there were 565 freshmen, 433 sophomores, 579 juniors, and 444 seniors.\n\n## Major\n\n**Which of the following categories best describes your major? (n=2089, 99% of 2110 reporting)**\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Student_Demographics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){fig-align='center' width=816}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*NOTE: Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) was shortened for the figure above, but also includes the following majors: Medicine, Computer Science, Agriculture, Accounting, Statistics, Nursing, and Nutrition.*\n\nThe majority of students in the data are majoring in a Public Health, Social Services, Social Science, and Education program (680 people). 624 of the students are Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) majors.\n\n<br />\n\n## Overall GPA\n\n**What is your approximate overall grade point average (GPA)? (n=2063, 98% of 2110 reporting)**\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Student_Demographics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){fig-align='center' width=528}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe average overall GPA for students is 3.31, while the median is 3.4. The majority (65.5%) of students have a GPA greater than 3.0.\n\n<br />\n\n## Currently Enrolled Units\n\n**How many units are you currently taking? (n=2090, 99% of 2110 reporting)**\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Student_Demographics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe average number of units a student is enrolled in is 12.86 units, while the median is 13 units. The majority of students are considered full-time (12 or more units), with 12 units being the highest occurring and 15 units being the second highest occurring.\n\n<br />\n\n## Student Identifiers\n\nThe following tables contain separate questions that were asked as a series of Yes/No responses to help further understand students. They were grouped together in this page by the start of the question.\n\n### I identify as...\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\">   </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Yes (%) </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> A Transfer Student (n = 2008). </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3.5cm; \"> 742 (37.0%) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> An ESL (English as a Second Language) student (n = 2020). </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3.5cm; \"> 581 (28.8%) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> LGBTQA+ (n = 1997). </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3.5cm; \"> 295 (14.8%) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> A student with a disability (n = 2013). </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3.5cm; \"> 248 (12.3%) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> A DREAM (i.e. undocumented) student (n = 2081). </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3.5cm; \"> 148 (7.1%) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> A former foster youth/child (n = 2084). </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3.5cm; \"> 127 (6.1%) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> A non-California resident (not International) (n = 2059). </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3.5cm; \"> 76 (3.7%) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> A DACA (i.e. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) student (n = 2073). </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3.5cm; \"> 65 (3.1%) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> A student athlete (n = 2073). </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3.5cm; \"> 50 (2.4%) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> An International student (n = 2079). </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3.5cm; \"> 22 (1.1%) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> A Veteran of military service (n = 2100). </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3.5cm; \"> 14 (0.7%) </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Disability Support Services\n\n*Note*: This name varies by campus and may not always be called the Disability Support Service Center.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\">   </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Yes (%) </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> I identify as a student with a disability (n = 2013) </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3.5cm; \"> 248 (12.3%) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> I receive services through my campus for a disability (n = 2065) </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3.5cm; \"> 195 (9.4%) </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n",
