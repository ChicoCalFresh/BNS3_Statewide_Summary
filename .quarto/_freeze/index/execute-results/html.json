In addition, 186 (8.8%) students did not finish the survey. These two factors are the cause of missing data (i.e., not 100% of respondents reporting). In each table/figure, the n reporting refers to the total number of non-missing responses, while the percent reporting reflects the percent of non-missing responses.*\n\n<br />\n\n\n## Use of Website and Access to Data \n\nPlease reach out to our PI, Stephanie Bianco <span style=\"color: blue; text-decoration: underline;\">sbianco@csuchico.edu</span>, if you would like more information on using or citing this website, accessing the data, methods used, or survey instruments used.\n\n\n\n\n## How to Cite This Website\n\nCenter for Healthy Communities.
