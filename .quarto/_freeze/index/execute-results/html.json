The [Center for Healthy Communities](https://www.csuchico.edu/chc/) (CHC) developed the **Basic Needs Student Success Survey (BNS3)** and administered it to undergraduate students participating in the [Educational Opportunity Program (EOP)](https://www2.calstate.edu/attend/student-services/eop) or the Extended Opportunity Programs and services (EOPS) at 12 colleges across the CSU, CCC and UC systems from 2022 to 2023.\n\nEOP/EOPS offices assisted in the recruitment by emailing interest form links to their EOP/EOPS students. Students who met the eligibility criteria of being undergraduate EOP/EOPS students and receiving less than 11 meals per week from other services (used as an eligibility criteria when determining CalFresh eligibility) were then emailed a survey. Participants were given a \\$25 gift card incentive for completing the survey. EOP/EOPS students were identified as the target population for this survey based on their low-income and first-generation student status, which indicates a higher probability of using CalFresh and being likely eligible for CalFresh.\n\nThe main purpose of this third cross-sectional study was to evaluate the following:\n\n1.  The impact of receiving [CalFresh](https://www.csuchico.edu/calfresh/index.shtml) benefits\n2. Barriers to applying to CalFresh\n3. College student food insecurity\n4. The impact of and barriers to using food pantries\n\nThis report provides a top level descriptive analysis of each question in the survey. Researchers and campus staff are encouraged to review the information in this analysis to formulate additional research questions and hypotheses.\n\n## Participants\n\nA total of 2,110 EOP/EOPS students in California were surveyed from the following campuses:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer on Missing Data:** *Students had the option to select \"Prefer not to answer\" for all questions or options such as \"I don't know\" for a small subset of questions, and these responses were set as missing values. In addition, 186 (8.8%) students did not finish the survey. These two factors are the cause of missing data (i.e., not 100% of respondents reporting). The n reporting refers to the total number of non-missing responses while the percent reporting reflects the percent of non-missing responses.*\n\n<br />\n\n### [How to use this website](Instructions.html)\n\n*Click above for instructions on how to navigate the website and interpret graphs.*\n",
