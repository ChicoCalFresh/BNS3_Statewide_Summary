This includes changes due to COVID, if they are living near their college (with most schools being remote at the time of the survey), the type of home they current live in, and hardships that they faced in the past year with housing.\n\n## Living Near College\n\n**Are you currently living in the city/area in which you are enrolled in college?

There also are 1441 students that say they do live in the city/area of their enrolled college. This high \"No\" value could likely be due to many campuses being remote and students choosing to live at home or in an area with a lower cost of living.\n:::\n:::\n\n<br />\n\n## Current Housing Situation\n\n**Which best describes your current housing situation?**\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Current Housing Situation </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Yes (%) </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> I live with parents or other relatives, not paying rent with my own money </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3.5cm; \"> 629/2004 (31.4%) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> I live with parents or other relatives, paying rent with my own money </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3.5cm; \"> 488/2004 (24.4%) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> I rent an apartment or house with roommates </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3.5cm; \"> 292/2004 (14.6%) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> I rent an apartment or house without roommates </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3.5cm; \"> 239/2004 (11.9%) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> I live in university housing or residence halls </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3.5cm; \"> 181/2004 (9.0%) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Other (Please specify): </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3.5cm; \"> 56/2004 (2.8%) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> I own my own home </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3.5cm; \"> 53/2004 (2.6%) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> I am temporarily living with friends or relatives without permanent housing (i.e. couch surfing) </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3.5cm; \"> 39/2004 (1.9%) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> I am currently living at an outdoor location, abandoned building, car, or other area not meant for regular housing without permanent housing </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3.5cm; \"> 13/2004 (0.6%) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> I live in transitional housing or a halfway home </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3.5cm; \"> 11/2004 (0.5%) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> I am temporarily living in a homeless shelter without permanent housing </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3.5cm; \"> 2/2004 (0.1%) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> I live in a sorority or fraternity house </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3.5cm; \"> 1/2004 (0.0%) </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\n## In the past 12 months...\n\n*The following were asked as a series of Yes/No questions to help better understand the living situations of participating students.*\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\">   </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Yes (%) </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Was there a rent or mortgage increase that made it difficult to pay?
