Students were asked to evaluate how they feel these programs have benefited them both academically and non-academically, as well as barriers/reasons in regards to why they are not using certain programs. This includes programs such as CalFresh, Food Pantries, Medi-Cal (also known as Medi-Cade in the United States), and Emergency Housing Services.\n\n<br>\n\n## CalFresh EBT\n\n*Note: for the first graph on EBT application we have (n=652, 31% of 2110 reporting). And for the second graph on how many people are fed we have (n=620, 29% of 2110 reporting).*\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Impact_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){fig-align='center' width=480}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Impact_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-2.png){fig-align='center' width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLooking at the above graphs, the majority of people apply for CalFresh EBT as an individual (355 people) while only 297 people applied with other people in their household. Similarly, the majority of people claimed only 1 person is fed through the EBT card (230 people). 138 people claim to feed 2 people through the EBT card, and only a small amount of people claim to feed 5 or more people through the EBT card.\n\n<br>\n\n### Monthly CalFresh Money\n\n**How much money do you receive from CalFresh each month? (n=634, 30% of 2110 reporting).**\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Impact_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe average amount of money received per household using CalFresh (denoted by the dotted line) is \\$305.91, while the median is \\$250. The values range from \\$0 to \\$1500. The majority of households who do receive these benefits seems to be getting around \\$250 or less per month.\n\n### Household Size Breakdown\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the average monthly allowance received from CalFresh based on household size.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Household Size </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Household Average </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Per Person Average </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $196.58 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $196.58 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $309.51 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $154.76 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 3 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $387.99 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $129.33 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $450.56 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $112.64 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 5 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $453.57 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $ 90.71 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 6 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $536.85 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $ 89.48 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 7 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $521.00 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $ 74.43 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 8 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $402.14 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $ 50.27 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;font-weight: bold;\">  </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;font-weight: bold;\"> Total Average </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;font-weight: bold;\"> $112.28 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLooking at the above table, the general pattern seems to be that as household size increases so does the monthly average assistance from CalFresh. The household average was divided by the household size to find the \"per person average\" for CalFresh assistance. From taking the average of these values, we can see that a person on CalFresh receives an average monthly assistance of $112.28.\n\n### Is This Enough?\n\n*Note: for the first graph on if the allowance is enough we have (n=623, 30% of 2110 reporting). And for the second graph on when people run out we have (n=586, 28% of 2110 reporting).*\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Impact_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Impact_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-2.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOf the people who do receive money from CalFresh, 224 of them agree that it is enough money to provide healthy food for a month and 288 of them feel that it is not enough. People typically run out of CalFresh money in the first week (127 people), the second week (156 people) or the third week (160 people). A smaller minority run out within the fourth week or do not use up all their monthly balance.\n\n<br>\n\n## CalFresh Benefits\n\n**While you received CalFresh benefits:**\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Impact_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){fig-align='center' width=816}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Impact_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-2.png){fig-align='center' width=816}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## CalFresh Barriers\n\n**What are the reasons you do not have CalFresh or have never used CalFresh?
