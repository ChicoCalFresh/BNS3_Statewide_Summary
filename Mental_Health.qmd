# Feelings

## Frequency of Negative Feelings

**Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by the following problems?** [^1]

names(questions) <- c("Feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge",
                      "Not being able to stop or control worrying",

```{r}
#| fig-height: 8

questions <- bns %>% select(starts_with("q109_"))
names(questions) <- c("Little interest or pleasure in doing things ",
                      "Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless ",
                      "Trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much ",

                      "Moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed. Or the opposite -being so fidgety or restless that you have been moving around a lot more than usual",
                      "Thoughts that you be better off dead, or of hurting yourself")

plot_likert(questions,
            grid.range = c(1.2, 1.2),
            wrap.legend.labels = 20,
            expand.grid = FALSE,
            values = "sum.outside",
            catcount = 4,

            show.prc.sign = TRUE, reverse.scale = TRUE) + theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "top")
```

<br />

## Current Feelings
**Which statement best describes how you are feeling right now? `r print_n_reporting("q110")`**

```{r}
plot_frq(bns$q110, geom.colors = plot_color, ylim=c(0,300), wrap.labels = 16, sort.frq = 'desc') + xlab('') + ylab("Number of Students")
```

Of the `r unname(sum(table(bns$q110)))` students, `r unname(table(bns$q110)[1])` reported feeling safe while `r unname(table(bns$q110)[2])` reported having suicidal thoughts. `r unname(table(bns$q110)[3])` student reported currently having suicidal thoughts with a plan for how they might do it.

<br />

# Services

## Mental Health Services - Access

**Do you have access to mental health services on your campus? `r print_n_reporting("q113")`**

```{r}
plot_frq(bns$q113, geom.colors = plot_color, ylim=c(0,1500), wrap.labels = 16, sort.frq = 'desc') + xlab('') + ylab("Number of Students")
```

Of the `r unname(sum(table(bns$q113)))` students, the majority (`r unname(table(bns$q113)['Yes'])`) said yes to having access to on campus mental health services. Roughly one fourth of students were unsure, and a smaller minority stated they did not have access to on campus mental health services.

<br />

**What statement(s) best describe why you might feel unsure about your ability to access mental health services on campus?**

```{r}
question <- "access_mhs"
qlabel <- c("I'm not sure what these kinds of services are",
            "I haven't needed these services, so I haven't looked into them",
            "I don't know what services are available",
            "I haven't heard anyone talking about these services",
            "I don't believe in therapy, so I haven't looked into them",
            "I don't know where to find information about them, so I'm not sure about what they are"
            )

access_mhs_vars <- prep_binary_vars(question, qlabel)

# Plot table of percentages
access_mhs_vars %>% 
  select(Measure = xlab, "Yes (%)" = pct_lab) %>% 
  kable() %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped")
```

<br />

## Mental Health Services - Use

**Have you used any of these campus-based mental health services within the last 12 months?**

```{r}
plot_frq(bns$q114, geom.colors = plot_color, ylim=c(0,1500), wrap.labels = 16, sort.frq = 'desc') + xlab('') + ylab("Number of Students")
```

The vast majority of students (`r unname(table(bns$q114)['No'])`) responded "No" to using any of the on campus based mental health services within the last 12 months. Only `r unname(table(bns$q114)['Yes'])` reported using the mental health service offered by their campus in the last 12 months.

<br />

**What type(s) of services did you use? (Please select all that apply)**

```{r}
question <- "counseling"

qlabel <- c("Counseling (one-on-one)",
            "Counseling (drop-in)",
            "Counseling (group)",
            "Other support services")




counseling_vars <- prep_binary_vars(question, qlabel) ## Issues here

            "The support I received was what I wanted",

            "I was able to schedule a follow-up if needed ",
            "I would recommend these services to someone else")

plot_likert(questions2,
            grid.range = c(1.2, 1.2),
            wrap.legend.labels = 20,
            expand.grid = FALSE,
            values = "sum.outside",
            catcount = 5,
